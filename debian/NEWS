revpi-sos-report (2.1.0-1+deb12+1) bookworm; urgency=medium

  New CODESYSControl configuration files are now collected as well.

  There was some information missing in the man page for revpi-sos so it was
  edited to include more information about revpi-sos, like how it works, as
  well as further explanation of what it is for, where it should be sent and
  when, and examples about how to check the content of the resulting archive.

  The info messages of revpi-sos have been improved to be more grammatically
  correct.
